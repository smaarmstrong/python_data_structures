# What is big O, Omega, and Theta in the context of programming? Provide a real world example of them.

# Worst, Best, and Average case scenarios in terms of time and space complexity. 
# From the beginning of iterating through a list, finding x at the start is omega,
# middle is theta, and end is big O.

# What is time complexity? 
# Number of operations in an algorithm.

# What is space complexity?
# Memory needed to perform the operations.

# What is the second worst O case? Write an example of it.
# O(n) NEED AN EXAMPLE!!!

# How can we simplify O(2n)? Write an example of O(2n).
# Drop the constant to O(n). NEED AN EXAMPLE!!!

# What is the least efficient O case?
# O(n^2) VERIFY!!!!

# How can we simplify O(n^2 + n)? Write an example of O(n^2 + n).
# We can drop n and simplify to O(n^2) but I forget the term.
# VERIFY AND FIND EXAMPLE!!!

# What is the most efficient O case? What is this case also known as? 
# Write an example of this case.
# O(1) is known as constant time. NEED AN EXAMPLE.

# What is the second best O case? 
# O(log n)

# What is the O case occasionally used for sorting algorithms?
# O(n log n) or something like that. VERIFY!

# TAKING A BREAK, MOST OF THE BELOW IS UNANSWERED

# Write an example of O(n).

# Write an example of O(a + b).

# Write an example of O(a * b).

# List two examples of list operations that are O(1). Why are they O(1)?
# list.pop() and list.push()

# List two examples of list operations that are O(n). Why are they O(n)?

# When you iterate through a list to find an item, what O case is that?
#

# When you find an item through o_list[n], what O case is that?

# Suppose n = 100, what do the big 4 O cases equal?

# Describe the big 4 O cases with only a few words.

# What is a good reference website for O cases?
