# suppose n = 100, what do the big 4 O operations equal?
# O(1) = 1
# O(log n) â‰ˆ 7
# O(n) = 100
# O(n^2) = 1,000,000
# this is a way of visualizing the efficiency between these O cases

# O(n^2) is a loop within a loop
# O(n) is proportional
# O(log n) is divide and conquer
# O(1) is constant time

# bigocheatsheet.com is a good reference for this stuff
