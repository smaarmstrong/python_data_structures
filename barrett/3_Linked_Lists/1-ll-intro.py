# There are some key differences between a list in python
# and a Linked List.

# 1) Linked Lists don't have indices.
# 2) Linked Lists nodes are not contiguous in memory.
# 3) Linked List heads are the first node in a linked list.
# 4) Linked List tails are the last node in a linked list.
# 5) Heads point to the next item in the list and so on until the
# penultimate node points to the tail. The tail points to None.
