# Big O is a way of comparing algorithms mathematically

# Measuring the time it takes to execute code is time complexity,
# though this is more about how many operations there are,
# since computers will execute code at different speeds depending 
# on their tech specs.

# Space complexity is about how much memory it takes to execute
# a code.

# (This course will deal mostly with time complexity)

# Big O is also your worst case scenario when executing a code,
# e.g. starting from the beginning of a list to find the end number.

# Omega is the best case (find at the beginning of the list)
# Theta is the average case (find in the middle of the list)
